## Project Overview

KidDo is a secret-agent-themed skill-building app for kids ages ~9-12. KidDo game-ifies learning and task management, allowing the user to collect "photo evidence" with their phone's camera in order to complete tasks centered around health, social/emotional, academic, and basic life skills. A kid "Agent" receives positive reinforcement by collecting points for completing tasks within a mission, working toward earning badges for each type of task.

The [KidDo Backend Repo](https://github.com/kiddo-capstone/kiddo-backend) and [server]() enables full CRUD methodology for our app

From here, data is displayed in the app for students to find an older adult whose needs they feel most suited to assist with.
