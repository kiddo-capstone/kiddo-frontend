## Project Overview

KidDo is a secret-agent-themed skill-building app for kids ages ~9-12. KidDo game-ifies learning and task management, allowing the user to collect "photo evidence" with their phone's camera in order to complete tasks centered around health, social/emotional, academic, and basic life skills. A kid "Agent" receives positive reinforcement by collecting points for completing tasks within a mission, working toward earning badges for each type of task.
